# What does this do? 
This application is a statically served React app that allows people to login to our application to view information stored in our Firebase database. 

Our application is has two components, the web application, and the mobile application. The mobile application allows users to file issues with their utility companies, e.g. water company, electrical company, and view information and updates about those complaints in real time.

The web application is meant for service providers to view these complaints, and send technicians directly to the locations based on how close they are to the site.
